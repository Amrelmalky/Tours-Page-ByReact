### pseudo codeeeee

#### (1) - Fetch data from givan url data
=====================================


ðŸ‘‰Create Loading logic while fetch data using State

ðŸ‘‰ Fetch data using async fetch method with UseEffect to rendard the data once when 
  the  application rendared for the first time 

  // Fetch data
  const fetchTours = async () => {
    setLoading(true); // Make sure for sure that loading variable = true
    try {
      const response = await fetch(url);
      const tours = await response.json();

      setLoading(false);
      setTours(tours);

    } catch (error) {
      setLoading()
      console.log(error);
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchTours();
  }, []);


  #### (2) - Tours Displaying Data
  =========================

  ðŸ‘‰ In App comp we are Passing tours variable = our date array of objects
    As a props to <Tours tours={tours}/> component .

  ðŸ‘‰ In Our Tours componenet we looping using Map Method through each object in array 
    in our array of data .

  ðŸ‘‰ In Tours component start Passing Each of object properity to <Tour/> Component 
    As a props using a desturcturing technique for objects {...object}.
  
  ðŸ‘‰ In Tour component start to desturcturing technique for objects {...object}
     In order to use object properties Tour = ({ id, name, info, image, price })

  ðŸ‘‰ In the last start to Display our data 

    article Tag
       â†“
     image src {image } alt ={name}
       â†“
     footer Tag
       â†“
       div with class tour-info
       h4 {name} 
       h4 {price}
       /div 
       â†“
       p {info}
       button

#### (4)- Working with functionality 
  =========================

  [first logic] â†’  Playing with Tours info 


ðŸ‘‰  Display limited info and if user press (Read more...)
    He can see the full info about that Tour Then Can Press (Read Less...) to return back.


ðŸ‘‰  doing that using useState


  [Second logic ] â†’  Tours delete button 

   

ðŸ‘‰ ask yourself small question where is my data ? in App component it is the place we  
   started to fetch data ,  So that the place we will create our deleted function,
   then pass it to parent <Tours/> then to child.


ðŸ‘‰ in Child component we will invoke this function.
